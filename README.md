# 🏗 scaffold-eth | 🏰 BuidlGuidl

## 🚩 Challenge 1: 🥩 Decentralized Staking App

> 🦸 A superpower of Ethereum is allowing you, the builder, to create a simple set of rules that an adversarial group of players can use to work together. In this challenge, you create a decentralized application where users can coordinate a group funding effort. If the users cooperate, the money is collected in a second smart contract. If they defect, the worst that can happen is everyone gets their money back. The users only have to trust the code.

> 🏦 Build a `Staker.sol` contract that collects **ETH** from numerous addresses using a payable `stake()` function and keeps track of `balances`. After some `deadline` if it has at least some `threshold` of ETH, it sends it to an `ExampleExternalContract` and triggers the `complete()` action sending the full balance. If not enough **ETH** is collected, allow users to `withdraw()`.

> 🎛 Building the frontend to display the information and UI is just as important as writing the contract. The goal is to deploy the contract and the app to allow anyone to stake using your app. Use a `Stake(address,uint256)` event to <List/> all stakes.

> 🌟 The final deliverable is deploying a Dapp that lets users send ether to a contract and stake if the conditions are met, then `yarn build` and `yarn surge` your app to a public webserver.  Submit the url on [SpeedRunEthereum.com](https://speedrunethereum.com)!

🧫 Everything starts by ✏️ Editing `Staker.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

```bash

git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-challenges.git challenge-1-decentralized-staking

cd challenge-1-decentralized-staking

git checkout challenge-1-decentralized-staking

yarn install

```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `Staker.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contract

🔭 Environment 📺

You'll have three terminals up for:

```bash
yarn start   (react app frontend)
yarn chain   (hardhat backend)
yarn deploy  (to compile, deploy, and publish your contracts to the frontend)
```

> 💻 View your frontend at http://localhost:3000/

> 👩‍💻 Rerun `yarn deploy --reset` whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend.

working of the dapp
> User gives the stake amount input and stakes the amount in the staker contract
> Based on the interest logic of the contract users can withdraw the amount after withdrawl period limit is crossed
> If the user didn't claim the withdraw before the claim period then the amount gets locked in staker contract
> we can transfer the amount to the external contract after claim period by using execute function
> A whitelist is created when we stake in contract so the only poeple in whitelist can restore the amount from the external contract by using restore contract
> After restore contract the claim and withdrawl time gets reset. so we can stake the amount again .
